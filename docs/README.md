Legal Tabular Review

This is the project document for a take-home assignment. The goal is to extract key information from multiple legal documents and present it as a structured table for fast side-by-side comparison and review.

Project Positioning
- Structured information extraction and comparison for legal document review
- Input: multiple legal documents; Output: a table aligned for cross-document comparison
- Emphasis on consistent field extraction and standardized representations

Core Goals
- Extract key information from contracts, regulations, judgments, and similar texts
- Normalize fields into a unified schema and data types
- Present results in a tabular format for horizontal comparison and review

Scope and Non-Goals
Scope
- Document parsing and field extraction
- Structured table generation
- Review-oriented comparison layout

Non-Goals
- Fully automated legal opinions or conclusions
- Replacing human legal review workflows
